What is it?
An animatronic tail based off of xenophobe alien tail

What does it do?
It either uses a pulse monitor to detect heart rate, and speeds up based on heart bpm or has 4 buttons with different tail settings. Example, tag wag left right, tail wag left right fast, tuck under, raise, stop. 

How do you use it?
Attach pulse rate monitor to wrist, witness the action. Or alternatively, press one of the four buttons.

How does it work?
Attaching braker wires to the left and right side of the tail. Attach the wires to the servo. Rotation of the servo pulls on one wire, and raises the tail to one side.

Who is your target audience?
Anyone! who enjoys dressing up. Or being an advanced humanoid. 

Where is it meant to be seen?
On the streets of new york, runways of Milan. 

Why are you interested in it?
I think we’ve all thought about having a tail when we were kids. It’s mostly a nostalgic endeavor. And something about being trapped in bodies. I could write a philosophical dissertation on it.

Why will other people be interested in it?
It’s out of this world! And a step closer to being a cyborg. It’s like body modification but less neurotic and permanent.
